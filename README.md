# Connect 4 Group Project

Created by Misty Pacaco, Diarte Jeffcoat and Zac Gerber

## Concept

We created a space themed Connect 4 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Originally it was supposed to be Star Wars themed, but because of some glitches and bugs during development, we decided to just make it a basic space theme.
